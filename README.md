# Jenga Game

In this small hardware project i made a game with the leap motion.
With that i wanted to get to know Unrea Engine a bit better.

## Features

I made this project in blueprints to learn more about how to work with them and see 
how new hardware worked with it.

## Software Anaylse 
I first started to search how it worked and it turns out that it works the same as the kinect.
it works with infrared dots and light to determine where the object is.

## Learning goals 
What i wanted to learn making this project
- Learn how the leap motion works
- Learn how to use blueprints in Unreal
